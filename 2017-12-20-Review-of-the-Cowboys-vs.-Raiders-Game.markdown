### Pre-Game

This was the last game of Ezekiel Elliott's 6 game suspension. However, for his return to be meaningful and to stay in the playoff race, we had to win this game. We didn't get any benefits from other contending teams as they too won earlier in the day. However, as long as we won, we were going to stay in the playoff race but with lower odds of actually getting in. The biggest concern before the game was going into O. Co Coliseum as it is one of the most hostile environments to play in.

### First Half

My father and I went to a family friend's house to watch the game. The game started out with a huge scare with a Dak Prescott interception. As all of us are huge Cowboys fans, most of us were suddenly dejected while the rest of us still had hope. Thankfully, with a 3 and out by the Raiders, we were back with the ball with the score as 0-0. After driving the ball 41 yards in 9 plays and 4:08, we were able to come away with a field goal. With another 3 and out by the Raiders, we drove down the field and scored a touchdown. Now, we started feeling confident in our Dallas Cowboys.

By mere luck, the Oakland kicker Tavecchio hooked the football wide left missing the uprightsallowing us to head in to halftime with a 10-0 lead.

With a Raiders' touchdown and another Dak Prescott interception deep on our side of the field, the momentum of the game and the moods drastically shifted. Within nine minutes of starting the second half, the game was tied at 10-10. With another 3 and out imminent, the Cowboys sent out the their special teams unit with punter Chris Jones. Catching all fans and coaches off guard, Chris Jones ran the ball for 24 yards to the Dallas 48 reinvigorating an underperforming Cowboys offense. With newfound momentum, the Cowboys scored a touchdown taking a lead of 17-10. However, within 5 minutes, the Raiders scored a touchdown to even the ball game in the 4th quarter. After exchanging 3 and outs, the Cowboys began their final march down the field. However, once more the Cowboys were stopped for a 4th & 1 at their own 40 yard line leading to one of the most interesting play if not the most interesting play of the night.

	#### The Index Card Ruling

	The 4th & 1 was too close to call with the naked eye. Thus, the referee Gene Steratore decided to bring the chains out to measure the ball's location. However, even with the chains, Gene couldn't determine whether or not the
