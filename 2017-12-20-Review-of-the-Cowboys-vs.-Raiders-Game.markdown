### Pre-Game

This was the last game of Ezekiel Elliott's 6 game suspension. However, for his return to be meaningful and to stay in the playoff race, we had to win this game. We didn't get any benefits from other contending teams as they too won earlier in the day. However, as long as we won, we were going to stay in the playoff race but with lower odds of actually getting in. The biggest concern before the game was going into O. Co Coliseum as it is one of the most hostile environments to play in.

### During the Game

My father and I went to a family friend's house to watch the game. The game started out with a huge scare with a Dak Prescott interception. As all of us are huge Cowboys fans, most of us were suddenly dejected while the rest of us still had hope. Thankfully, with a 3 and out by the Raiders, we were back with the ball with the score as 0-0. After driving the ball 41 yards in 9 plays and 4:08, we were able to come away with a field goal.
