Hello! My name is Aniruth Kasthuri. This is my very first blog post ever!


#### Goals to achieve in this blog

I have been wanting to create a blog for a long time. However, I never was able to take the time to do so. With the new year coming around, I wanted to finally start this blog. My goal is to talk about mydaily life, cool topics that I come across, and current events.

#### About Me 

* I am an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
* I am from Texas and I love being home.
* I love running and I enjoy sports.
* I enjoy watching the Dallas Cowboys, San Antonio Spurs, and the Texas Rangers.
* I relish a good documentary and enjoy learning anything new.

This concludes my first blog post. Thank you for reading this post and hopefully you will continue following my blog for any new updates.
